Some Personal Configurations.

##For YCM 

It turns out you should make the version used by MacVim be consistent with the one YCM is using. Since YCM is using the home brew version of Python, I simply created a simbolic link from the python framework which originally came from the Mac OS X system to the one from home brew. Thus cheat the MacVim to use the one built by home brew.

##Taglist

It only works with Exuberant-ctags. Be aware.
